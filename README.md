# ZYLO-RiG0R

ZYLO-RiG0R is an ultra-fast, research-grade math & physics reasoning engine built on GPT-OSS-120B with Cerebras-accelerated inference and strict tool-augmented computation.

Unlike generic chat systems, ZYLO-RiG0R forces verified computation, executes sandboxed Python and SymPy, and optionally rechecks proofs using GLM-4.7, ensuring results are correct, reproducible, and defensible.

It is designed to outperform top-tier AI models on calculation-heavy, exam-level, and research-grade problems by eliminating hallucinations and unverifiable reasoning.
